# How to Make Phone Calls with the Nexmo Client SDK on iOS using Swift

In this guide, we'll learn how to place a call from a Nexmo app to a phone device (PSTN) by implementing a webhook and linking that to a Nexmo application.

You will create a simple app to place a call.

The app will automatically log in a user called Jane. After logging in, Jane is able to place a call and perform actions such as cancel or hangup.

## Prerequisites

- [Create a Nexmo Application](/tutorials/client-sdk-generate-test-credentials).
- Have a [user for your Nexmo Application, with a valid JWT](/tutorials/client-sdk-generate-test-credentials).
- [Add Nexmo SDK to your project](/tutorials/client-sdk-ios-add-sdk-to-your-app).
